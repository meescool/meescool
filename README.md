Hi there! I'm a front-end/mapping developer and illustrator based in Nebraska. 
I really enjoy the act of creating, and found that code and art have a
a lot of overlapping when it comes to planning, problem solving and innovating. 
I've also found that involving both in my learning process has allowed me to 
further deepen my knowledge and skill in both areas.
